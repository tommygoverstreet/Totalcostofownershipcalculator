# OKC Vehicle Sales TCO Calculator

## 📖 App Description
The **OKC Vehicle Sales TCO Calculator** is a specialized financial intelligence tool designed specifically for the commercial trucking industry. It empowers owner-operators and fleet managers to go beyond simple purchase price comparisons by calculating the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** over the entire lifecycle of a commercial asset.

Unlike generic loan calculators, this application integrates industry-specific operational variables—such as variable maintenance curves, driver wages, and revenue projections—to provide a holistic view of a truck's true profitability.

### ⚙️ Dynamic Maintenance Modeling
